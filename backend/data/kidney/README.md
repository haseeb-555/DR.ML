Thanks! Based on your format, here is a clean and **focused `README.md`** specifically for the **Kidney Disease Streamlit Testing Module**, while clearly noting that the main app is FastAPI-based.

# 🧪 Kidney Disease Classifier – Streamlit Test Module

This is a **Streamlit-based testing module** for the **Kidney Disease Prediction** component of a larger disease diagnosis platform (which is being developed using **FastAPI**).  
It lets you enter clinical features and predict CKD using trained ML models like XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Random Forest.

---

## 📁 Project Context

This module is part of a broader medical ML system (`DR.ML`) with support for:

- 🧠 Brain Tumor (MRI-based)
- ❤️ Heart Disease
- 🧴 Skin Disease
- 🧬 Dementia
- 🔬 Kidney Disease (👈 current module)

Each module is located under `backend/preprocessing/` and integrated in the main **FastAPI app**.

## 🚀 How to Run the Streamlit Test App

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dr.ml.git
cd dr.ml
```
````

2. **Create & activate a virtual environment:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
source venv/bin/activate     # Mac/Linux
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the test app:**

```bash
streamlit run backend/testing/app3.py
```

## 📊 Prediction Details

- ✅ Uses models saved at `backend/models/kidney.joblib`
- ✅ Accepts 24 medical parameters related to CKD
- ✅ Displays prediction result and confidence

## 🛠 Developer Notes

⚠️ This Streamlit module is **not the production frontend**.

- Final app will use **FastAPI**
- All modules will be exposed via **REST API endpoints**
- Frontend will interact via fetch/axios calls
